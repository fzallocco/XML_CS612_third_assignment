Assignment: 3, question 3

I created an xml file that can easily be displayed in your browser along with its .dtd and .xsd equivalents that define the xml file's structure.
To parse the xml file and compare it to its schema, run the python file dom_parser_schema.py but not until you have installed xmlschema with pip install xmlschema.
To parse the xml file and compare it to it .dtd equivalent, execute the python file dom_parser_dtd.py
